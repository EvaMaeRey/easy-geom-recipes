No answer provided.



## 21.If there is a computational geom that you think should exist, but you don't have time to take it on, please describe that geom.  (for example, geom_lm_residuals() is a new function in the package ggxmean.   Is there something you're always drawing or would like to draw in ggplot2, but seems cumbersome to do in 'base ggplot2'?)
